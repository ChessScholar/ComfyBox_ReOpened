# ComfyBox_ReOpened

ComfyBox_ReOpened is a frontend to Stable Diffusion that lets you create custom image generation interfaces without any code. It uses [ComfyUI](https:/

## Usage
A preconfigured workflow is included for the most common txt2img and img2img use cases, so all it takes to start generating is clicking `Load Default` to load the default workflow and then `Queue Prompt`.

You can import your existing workflows from ComfyUI into ComfyBox by clicking `Load` and choosing the `.json` or `.png` with embedded metadata, or dropping either file onto the graph viewer.

## Features
- **No-Code UI Builder** - A novel system for creating your own Stable Diffusion user interfaces from the basic components.
- **Prompt Queue** - Queue up multiple prompts without waiting for them to finish first. Inspect currently queued and executed prompts.
- **Prompt History** - Browse through previously generated prompts and their output images/parameters.

### Requirements
- An installation of vanilla [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for the backend
